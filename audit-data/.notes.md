# Code Hawks First Flight: One Shot AUDIT PROCESS

**START** _Thursday 22 Feb, 2024_ [ 18:50]

## Goals

### Understanding Docs

#### Overview

A user mints a rapper NFT (One shot) and by staking, it gains experience which can be used to Rap battle against other NFTs for Cred

**?? _What is Cred_**

#### In OneShot.sol

When a user mints a rapper, it has default properties (flaws):

- `weakKnees` - True
- `heavyArms` - True
- `spaghettiSweater` - True
- `calmandReady` - False
- `battlesWon` - 0

- **Features**
  - Token minting
  - Value initialization

#### In Streets.sol

- Staked Rapper NFTs earn 1 Cred ERC20 per day staked up to 4 max
- For each day staked, a Rapper NFT will have props change that can help them in their next Rap Battle

- **Features**
  - Staking
  - Token transfer (minting probably)
  - Change of state variables

#### In RapBattle.sol

For a rap battle, users bet their Cred ERC20 and winner takes all.

A base skill of 50 is applied to all rappers in battle, the following properties held by Rapper NFT modifies the base skill

- WeakKnees = False +5
- HeavyArms = False +5
- SpaghettiSweater = False +5
- CalmAndReady = True +10

Each Rapper NFT skill is used to weigh the likelihood of randomly winning the battle

- **Features**
  - Change of state variables
  - Token Transfer
  - PseudoRandom Number Generator (PRNG)

#### CredToken.sol

An ERC20 token that represents a Rapper's credibility and **time** on the streets

- **Features**
  - Inheritance
  - ERC20 properties

#### Roles

**USER**

- Mint a RapperNFT
- Stake and Unstake their RapperNFT
- Go to battle ‚öîÔ∏è

### Understanding Contracts üìú

#### CredToken

- `setStreetsContract`: allows only owner to change the address of the Streets contract
- `mint`: allows only Streets Contract to mint Credibility ERC20 token

#### Streets

- `stake(uint256 tokenId)`:

  - maps a `OneShot` NFT `tokenId` to a `Stake` struct - `Stake(block.timestamp, msg.sender)`.
  - emits a `Staked` event while passing the necessary event fields.
  - a `OneShot` token transfer of the passed `tokenId` is made from the `msg.sender` balance to the `Streets` contract address.

- `unstake(uint256 tokenId)`:

  - a check is performed to verify if `msg.sender` is owner of staked `tokenId`
  - uint256 `stakedDuration` and `daysStaked` are determined
  - RapperStats is referenced and stored in memory using `stakedRapperStats` variable
  - `Unstaked` event gets emitted and `stakes[tokenId]` gets reset to default values
  - based on the `daysStaked`, various properties of the cached in memory `RapperStats stakedRapperStats` gets updated and `1 Cred ERC20` token gets minted to `msg.sender`
  - the `oneShotContract.updateRapperStats` function is called and the `tokenId`, and `RapperStats stakedRapperStats` fields get passed as arguments
  - finally, the RapperNFT with `tokenId` gets returned to the `msg.sender` from `Streets` contract üöÄ

- `onERC721Received(address, address, uint256, bytes calldata)`:
  - is an override pure function that does nothing but return `IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector`

#### OneShot

- `setStreetsContract(address streetsContract)`:
  - updates the `_streetsContract` state variable as the `Streets(streetsContract)`
- `mintRapper`:
  - sets a `tokenId` function scope variable to `_nextTokenId++`
  - calls `_safeMint(msg.sender, tokenId)`
  - initializes the metadata of the minted token and stores it in the `rapperStats[tokenId]` mapping.
- `updateRapperStats(uint256 tokenId, bool weakKnees, bool heavyArms, bool spaghettiSweater, bool calmAndReady, uint256 battlesWon)`:
  - can only be called by `Streets` contract
  - sets the `rapperStats[tokenId]` using the passed arguments
- `getRapperStats(uint256 tokenId)`:
  - returns `RapperStats` of the passed `tokenId`
- `getNextTokenId`:
  - returns `_nextTokenId`

#### RapBattle

- `goOnStageOrBattle(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _credBet)`:

  - checks if `defender` equals `address(0)`
    - if it does not,
      - `_battle(_tokenId, _credBet)` is called
    - if it equals,
      - `defender`, `defenderBet`, and `defenderTokenId` is set
      - `OnStage` event gets emitted
      - bet is placed by transferring `msg.sender` **ERC20** and **ERC721** tokens to `RapBattle` contract

- `\_battle(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _credBet)`:

  - within function scope, we set `address _defender` to state variable `defender`
  - a check is performed to ensure that `defenderBet` equals `credBet`
  - in memory, we store `defenderRapperSkill = getRapperSkill(defenderTokenId);` and `challengerRapperSkill = getRapperSkill(_tokenId);`
  - `totalBattleSkill = defenderRapperSkill + challengerRapperSkill`
  - a random generator using modulus operation of hashing the abi.encodePacked of (`block.timestamp`, `block.prevrando`, and `msg.sender`) and `totalBattleSkill` to determine the winner - random
  - `address defender` state variable is updated to `address(0)`
  - `Battle` event gets emitted
  - within the if-else block, a winner is determined and `credToken`(s) is transferred to the winner.
  - finally, the `OneShot` NFT of `defender` gets returned

- `getRapperSkill(uint256 _tokenId)... returns(uint256 finalSkill)`
  - within function scope, `RapperStats` for `_tokenId` is stored as `stats`
  - `finalSkill` is determined by subtracting by `VICE_DECREMENT` for every `RapperStats` boolean field that holds with the exception of `calmAndReady` which if `true`, results in adding `VIRTUE_INCREMENT`
